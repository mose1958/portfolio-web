                 <p>I did color theory back in 2022, which I interned for in Design Logistics Ltd the same year. I got to observe and create front-end designs with experts and this website has been modelled with the various tecniques i learnt.</p>
                 <p>I'm highly proficient in a couple of programming languages such as Java, python, C, C++, Javascript and some few others. I have also equipped myself with Database Management skills and look forward to becoming a complete full stack developer in due time. </p>
